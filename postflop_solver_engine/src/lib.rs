//! An open-source postflop solver library.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! See the [examples] directory.
//!
//! [examples]: https://github.com/b-inary/postflop-solver/tree/main/examples
//!
//! # Implementation details
//! - **Algorithm**: The solver uses the state-of-the-art [Discounted CFR] algorithm.
//!   Currently, the value of Î³ is set to 3.0 instead of the 2.0 recommended in the original paper.
//!   Also, the solver resets the cumulative strategy when the number of iterations is a power of 4.
//! - **Performance**: The solver engine is highly optimized for performance with maintainable code.
//!   The engine supports multithreading by default, and it takes full advantage of unsafe Rust in hot spots.
//!   The developer reviews the assembly output from the compiler and ensures that SIMD instructions are used as much as possible.
//!   Combined with the algorithm described above, the performance surpasses paid solvers such as PioSOLVER and GTO+.
//! - **Isomorphism**: The solver does not perform any abstraction.
//!   However, isomorphic chances (turn and river deals) are combined into one.
//!   For example, if the flop is monotone, the three non-dealt suits are isomorphic,
//!   allowing us to skip the calculation for two of the three suits.
//! - **Precision**: 32-bit floating-point numbers are used in most places.
//!   When calculating summations, temporary values use 64-bit floating-point numbers.
//!   There is also a compression option where each game node stores the values
//!   by 16-bit integers with a single 32-bit floating-point scaling factor.
//! - **Bunching effect**: At the time of writing, this is the only implementation that can handle the bunching effect.
//!   It supports up to four folded players (6-max game).
//!   The implementation correctly counts the number of card combinations and does not rely on heuristics
//!   such as manipulating the probability distribution of the deck.
//!   Note, however, that enabling the bunching effect increases the time complexity
//!   of the evaluation at the terminal nodes and slows down the computation significantly.

//! # Crate features
//! - `bincode`: Uses [bincode] crate (2.0.0-rc.3) to serialize and deserialize the `PostFlopGame` struct.
//!   This feature is required to save and load the game tree.
//!   Enabled by default.
//! - `custom-alloc`: Uses custom memory allocator in solving process (only available in nightly Rust).
//!   It significantly reduces the number of calls of the default allocator,
//!   so it is recommended to use this feature when the default allocator is not so efficient.
//!   Note that this feature assumes that, at most, only one instance of `PostFlopGame` is available
//!   when solving in a program.
//!   Disabled by default.
//! - `rayon`: Uses [rayon] crate for parallelization.
//!   Enabled by default.
//! - `zstd`: Uses [zstd] crate to compress and decompress the game tree.
//!   This feature is required to save and load the game tree with compression.
//!   Disabled by default.
